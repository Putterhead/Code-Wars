# Code-Wars
Completed Codewars problems and my notes 
I've kind of picked the low hanging fruit on Codewars so most of these are 8 kyu's. My comments might seem obvious or mundane
but it was more an exercise in seeing if I understood the code I actually wrote.
Anyway, I hope it helps some people starting out to get the ball rolling.
