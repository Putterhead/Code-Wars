# Code-Wars
Completed Codewars problems and my notes.
I've kind of picked the low hanging fruit on Codewars so most of these are 8 kyu's. My comments might seem obvious or mundane
but it is more an exercise in seeing if I understand the code I actually write and that of the best practices solutions.
Anyway, I hope it helps some people starting out to get the ball rolling.
